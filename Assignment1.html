	<h4>Why is Diversity Important?</h4>
	<h5>A diverse world is important to educate people on differences in lifestyle and beliefs around the world. Only when people see your perspective, may they begin to accept you as a person.</h5>
	<h4>Positives of Diversity</h4>
	<h5>Diversity betters all of the human race. People of numerous different cultures have created all of the modern technology we know and love. For example, Australians invented wifi, Traffic lights from African-Americans, Shampoo from India and millions of other things were created by people all around the world. Diversity betters our world, we are better off being #ONE.</h5>

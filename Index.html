	<h1>#ONE</h1>
	<h4>What is #ONE?</h4>
	<p>#ONE is a social media phenomenon designed to level the playing field in terms of racial equality! Australia is a diverse place, but not everyone is happy about this. Every Australian deserves to be accepted, so why not join on #ONE!! </p>

	<p>Many school students experience racial discrimination on a daily basis, so why not get your school involved!</p>
	<p>Racial discrimination is by far the most common, and #ONE has set out to do the opposite!!</p>
